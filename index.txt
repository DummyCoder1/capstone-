      <p>Extra-curricular classes are an essential component of education. As an educational institution, we believe in the student's holistic development and keep that goal. We have launched a new website with which we aim to inform students about the school's extra-curricular activities during the current academic year. We will post images of the past activities on the Photogallery page of the website. The schedule of the upcoming events is present on the timetable page.</p>
